## Understanding the motivation
The idea for this project was birthed from a tweet I saw about a famous YouTube creator saying that _a tool that can help analyse the enormous amount of comments that they get on each video_ wasn't yet present on the market. Being a data science practitioner and an avid YouTube fan, that tweet picked my brain and I was like, *this should be fun little challenge*. 

From then on, what began as an idea of a good, practical data science project, slowly developed into a full fledged web application with the help of the awesome frontend libary for data scientists called **Streamlit**(more later on this).

## How it works
Insight currently offers these features:
- Fetch all comments from any video from a YouTube video by pasting a URL, or
- Select and load any pre-existing csv file of comments that you might have already scraped before
- Perform the following operations on the comments:
  * Cluster the set of comments into different topics with a percentage assigned to each topic pertaining of how much people have talked about that something in the comments
  * Find top used emojis by the commentors üòç
  * Write a query and get comments semantically related to that query available to analyse
  * Form a pretty little word cloud of the comments, using any of the shapes in the drop down list like a cloud(duh), a dog, a retro camera, and others!


## See the app in action
Watch the demo video I made about the project (It's 3:06 minutes long. I worked very hard on this to **make it fun** rather than just a boring demo):

## Contribute to this project
I made Insight with two things in mind:
1. I wanted to build a real, usable app like this for the awesome YouTubers like [Peter Mckinnon](https://www.youtube.com/user/petermckinnon24) that I love.
2. I wanted to use and hone my skills in NLP by demonstrating its power to the world wth a practical app like this.

I have always been a backend-Java-Kotlin-Python guy and thus, I am unfortunately, very much lacking in frontend web development skills. Therefore, **if you are someone who is excited by the immense possibilites associated with this project and wants to make a modern, simplistic frontend for it**, PLEASE ping me in here via a [new Issue](https://github.com/yashprakash13/Insight/issues) or contact/DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/csandyash) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashprakash13/) whenever you can. 

I would love to collab with someone like you who is eager to use his skills make this project more awesome! Thanks for being here anyway. :heart:
