## Understanding the motivation
The idea for this project was birthed from a tweet I saw about a famous YouTube creator saying that _a tool that can help analyse the enormous amount of comments that they get on each video_ wasn't yet present on the market. Being a data science practitioner and an avid YouTube fan, that tweet picked my brain and this project is the result of that. 

From then on, what began as an idea of a good, practical data science project, slowly developed into a full fledged web application with the help of the awesome frontend libary for data scientists called **Streamlit**(more later on this).
