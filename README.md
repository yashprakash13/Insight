## Understanding the motivation
The idea for this project was birthed from a tweet I saw about a famous YouTube creator saying that _a tool that can help analyse the enormous amount of comments that they get on each video_ wasn't yet present on the market. Being a data science practitioner and an avid YouTube fan, that tweet picked my brain and I was like, *this should be fun little challenge*. üò∏

From then on, what began as an idea of a good, practical data science project, slowly developed into a full fledged web application with the help of the awesome frontend libary for data scientists called **Streamlit**(more later on this). 

## How it works
Insight currently offers these features:
- Fetch all comments from any video from a YouTube video by pasting a URL, or
- Select and load any pre-existing csv file of comments that you might have already scraped before
- Perform the following operations on the comments:
  * Cluster the set of comments into different topics with a percentage assigned to each topic pertaining of how much people have talked about that something in the comments
  * Find top used emojis by the commentors üòç
  * Write a query and get comments semantically related to that query available to analyse
  * Form a pretty little word cloud of the comments, using any of the shapes in the drop down list like a cloud(duh), a dog, a retro camera, and some others!


## See the app in action
This is what the app looks like:

You can also watch the demo video I made about the project (It's 3:16 long. I worked very hard on this to **make it fun** rather than just a boring demo):

## Contribute to this project
I made Insight with 2Ô∏è‚É£ things in mind:
1. I wanted to build a real, usable app like this with inspiration from some of the awesome YouTubers like [Peter Mckinnon](https://www.youtube.com/user/petermckinnon24) that I love. His videos are actually being used in the demo video I made. Go watch it üëÜüèª.
2. I wanted to use and hone my skills in NLP by demonstrating its power to the world wth a practical app like this.

I have always been a backend-Java-Kotlin-Python guy and thus, I am unfortunately, very much lacking in frontend web development skills. Therefore, **if you are someone who is excited by the immense possibilites associated with this project and wants to make a modern, simplistic frontend for it**, PLEASE ping me in here via a [new Issue](https://github.com/yashprakash13/Insight/issues) or contact/DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/csandyash) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashprakash13/) whenever you can. 

I would love to collab with someone like you who is eager to use his skills make this project more awesome! Thanks for being here anyway. :heart: 


## Try the app on your machine
1. Make a new directory to store the project:
```bash
mkdir InsightApp
```
2. **cd** into the directory:
```bash
cd InsightApp
```
3. Clone this repo: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashprakash13/Insight.git
```
4. Make a new virtual environment. I recommend using **pipenv**:
```bash
pipenv shell
```
5. **cd** into the app directory:
```bash
cd Insight
```
6. Build the app with **docker**:
```bash
docker build --tag insight:1.0 .
```
7. Run the app:
```bash
docker run --publish 8501:8501 -it insight:1.0
```
8. Navigate to https://localhost:8501 to explore the app! Don't forget to see the [demo video](#see-the-app-in-action) first to make sure you have a good grasp of the app's workings!

**If you want to build your own comments dataset with this app**, feel free to follow the entire process [I described in this blog post](https://medium.com/this-code/how-to-make-a-youtube-video-comments-dataset-with-the-googles-python-api-34cf32a14d16?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------). This will help you make your own ```creds.json``` file that you can keep in the root project directory when you run the app.

**I'm also making an online course-ebook with the WHOLE guide to building this project.** [You can book your copy here.](https://tremendous-founder-3862.ck.page/69e31e7b71) It's free too. :)

## How I built this app
Insight was built with these major components. A huge thank you to their creators for making these amazing tools available for free.
* [Google YouTube API](http://cloud.google.com) -> to download comments from videos, as I've described [here](https://medium.com/this-code/how-to-make-a-youtube-video-comments-dataset-with-the-googles-python-api-34cf32a14d16?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------).
* [Sentence Transformers](https://sbert.net) -> to enable semantic similarity search and information retrieval with by computing sentence embeddings, as described [here](https://pub.towardsai.net/a-quick-introduction-to-semantic-clustering-for-large-texts-3660a77b9611?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------).
* [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) -> the easy frontend development library for backend people like me :P I wrote a detailed blog post around it too [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-streamlit-frontend-for-data-science-made-simpler-c6dda54e3183?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------).
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) -> to easy deploy the app as a stand-alone container, like I've written [here](https://pub.towardsai.net/how-to-dockerize-your-data-science-project-a-quick-guide-b6fa2d6a8ba1?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------).

You might have a good idea by now that I absolutely LOVE to write. üòÅ
