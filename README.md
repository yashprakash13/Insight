## Understanding the motivation
The idea for this project was birthed from a tweet I saw about a famous YouTube creator saying that _a tool that can help analyse the enormous amount of comments that they get on each video_ wasn't yet present on the market. Being a data science practitioner and an avid YouTube fan, that tweet picked my brain and I was like, *this should be fun little challenge*. 

From then on, what began as an idea of a good, practical data science project, slowly developed into a full fledged web application with the help of the awesome frontend libary for data scientists called **Streamlit**(more later on this).

## How it works
Insight currently offers these features:
- Fetch all comments from any video from a YouTube video by pasting a URL, or
- Select and load any pre-existing csv file of comments that you might have already scraped before
- Perform the following operations on the comments:
  * Cluster the set of comments into different topics with a percentage assigned to each topic pertaining of how much people have talked about that something in the comments
  * Find top used emojis by the commentors üòç
  * Write a query and get comments semantically related to that query available to analyse
  * Form a pretty little word cloud of the comments, using any of the shapes in the drop down list like a cloud(duh), a dog, a retro camera, and others!
